# TODO: Add Search Bar in Upper Right

- [x] Add routes for browsing mangas (`/manga` for index and `/manga/{id}` for show) in `routes/web.php`.
- [x] Implement `index` and `show` methods in `MangaController.php` to handle manga listing and details, including search functionality by title or author.
- [x] Update the navigation bar in `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` to include a search form that submits to the manga index route.
